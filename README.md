# üöó IoT SmartParking

**IoT SmartParking** is an IoT-based parking management system that uses **MQTT** for device communication, **CherryPy** as the backend service, and a **Telegram bot** for user interaction. The system allows users to check parking slot availability, make reservations, and calculate parking fees.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Architecture

The project consists of the following components:

### 1. **Backend (CherryPy)**
- A RESTful API developed with **CherryPy** to manage:
  - Slot availability.
  - User reservations.
  - Parking exit and fee calculations.

### 2. **Communication (MQTT)**
- Devices use the **Paho MQTT** library to:
  - Send updates for parking slot status.
  - Receive commands and notifications.

### 3. **Database (InfluxDB)**
- **InfluxDB** is used for time-series data to store:
  - Entry and exit times of vehicles.
  - Parking sensor updates.

### 4. **Telegram Bot (ParkingBot)**
- A Telegram bot developed using **Telepot** that allows users to:
  - Check available slots.
  - Make reservations.
  - View their wallet with recent transactions.
